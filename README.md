# React Portfolio

## Description

This is my single-page application portfolio. Let's me walk you through this React Portfolio:

1. When you load the portfolio, you will be presented with the page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. When you view the header, you will be presented with my name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

2. When you view the navigation titles, you will be presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted. When you click on a navigation title, you will be presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

3. When you load this React Portfolio the first time, then the About Me title and section are selected by default; when you're presented with the About Me section, you can see my recent photo and a short bio. When you're presented with the Portfolio section, you can see titled images of my six applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.

4. When you're presented with the Contact section, you can see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message; when you move the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, a notification of that field is printed. When you enter text into the email address field, you'll receive a notification if you have entered an invalid email address.

5. When you're presented with the Resume section, you can see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of my proficiencies. When you view the footer, you can find text or icon links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and Twitter pages (Twitter link is a placeholder at this moment).
